Short semi-random projects/programs I make while learning python
Table of contents:

1) hourly timer.py:
This was the first program I made.  It tells you what time a timer will go off (including am/pm) based on when you start it and how long it is. (Doesn't actually set a timer)


2) modified random number generator.py:
This is a random number generator that's modified to run until it finds a number that is on a list. The list is reference numbers for different dinosaur genera, from several different taxa I'm interested in. (Yes, I know this is only minimally useful, and I could have saved a lot of time by just picking one species instead of writing this)
